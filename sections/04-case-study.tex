\subsection{Case Study Design}

To evaluate the architectural differences between implementing a microservice architecture with REST and GraphQL interfaces, a case study was performed.
The case study implements an online shopping scenario, where users can place orders with multiple items~\raisebox{.5pt}{\textcircled{\raisebox{-.9pt} {1}}}.
When new orders are received, the inventory is checked~\raisebox{.5pt}{\textcircled{\raisebox{-.9pt} {2}}} if the items are available and then reserved for the user~\raisebox{.5pt}{\textcircled{\raisebox{-.9pt} {3}}}.
Additionally, the shipping cost is calculated~\raisebox{.5pt}{\textcircled{\raisebox{-.9pt} {4}}}.
When a payment is received from an external payment provider~\raisebox{.5pt}{\textcircled{\raisebox{-.9pt} {5}}}, the total of the order is checked~\raisebox{.5pt}{\textcircled{\raisebox{-.9pt} {6}}} and if the payment suffices, the order is marked ready for shipping~\raisebox{.5pt}{\textcircled{\raisebox{-.9pt} {7}}}~\raisebox{.5pt}{\textcircled{\raisebox{-.9pt} {8}}} and the reserved items can be booked out~\raisebox{.5pt}{\textcircled{\raisebox{-.9pt} {9}}}.
This process is shown in \autoref{fig:interaction}.
