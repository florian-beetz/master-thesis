\subsection{Representational State Transfer (\acs{REST})}

\ac{REST} is an architectural style for network-based applications coined by Fielding~\cite{Fielding2000}.
Webservices and \acp{API} following this style are often referred to as \acs{REST}ful \acp{API}.
According to Fielding, this style focuses ``on the roles of components, the constraints upon their interaction with other components, and their interpretation of significant data elements''.
One of the key aspects of his definition is the word \textit{style}, because \ac{REST} is not a guideline or a standard~\cite{Malakhov2018}.
